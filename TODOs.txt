=== TODOs ===
P1
* check debug settings for production
* add user auth / checking

P2
* change card to tuple

P3
* improve Registy to query all id's at once at game start (query)
* api: match: add a from index param as well for easy polling

=== BUGs KNOWN ===
* Kraken->Cannon/Map->Oracle //BUG: not working yet
* // Kraken->Hook/Sword/Map->
Missing:
* Kraken first card reaction

=== RULES - the small details ===
* Kraken must draw two if drawpile allows: Upon card effect for first Kraken card cannot be fulfilled, thus is nullified, the second card needs to be drawn (e.g. Kraken->Map(empty discard)->[!], Kraken->Hook(with empty bank)->[!], Kraken->Sword(with empty or all existing suit stacks) ))
* Kraken cancels Oracle effect if drawn first, as you will draw next card anyways: Kraken->Oracle[X]->X
* Sword cannot draw existing stack


================================================================

* serialization / deserialization through ddmapper is a big risk, one failure propagates --> manual deserialization could be an option...
