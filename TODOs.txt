=== TODOs ===

* generator pattern for all "switched" types (effect/event for meainginful deserialization) via ctor 
    --> maybe not such a big issue / we dont want to do anything with cardeffects and evebts after restoring the state
    --> still should check effect based on type instead of class

    // events not restored e.g. turnstarted.currentplayer
    // not event serialized!
* 

P1
* check debug settings for production
* add user auth / checking


P2
* change card to tuple

P3
* improve Registy to query all id's at once at game start (query)
* api: match: add a from index param as well for easy polling

=== BUGs KNOWN ===
* Kraken->Cannon->Oracle //BUG: not working yet
