=== TODOs ===
P1
* check debug settings for production
* add user auth / checking
* drawpile seed based randomization and ordering on match start, might also need to persist the random seed (for picking map from discardpile consistently?) maybe use app.locals instead of injection
* mongodb authentication (and keeping env as a secret)

P2
* draw timeout handling with repolling of db on "wrong" user

P3
* api: match: add a from index param as well for easy polling
* bootstrap / react app

=== BUGs KNOWN ===
N/A

=== RULES - the small details ===
* Kraken must draw two if drawpile allows
  * cancels Oracle effect if drawn first, as you will need draw a second card anyways: Kraken->Oracle[X]->X
  * if first card successfully triggers effect (Hook, Map, Sword), no forced second draw is triggered
  * upon card effect for first Kraken card cannot be fulfilled, thus is nullified, the second card needs to be drawn (e.g. Kraken->Map(empty discard)->[!], Kraken->Hook(with empty bank)->[!], Kraken->Sword(with empty or all existing suit stacks) ))
* Sword effect cannot pick enemy Suit from which own Player already has someting in its Bank
* drawpack - initially pick smallest of each suit
